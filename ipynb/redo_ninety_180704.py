# # Use Mims to Calculate the Conversion Factor

# We rearrange Eq. 9 from [3.]:
# $$F =
# B_{1,avg}
# \sqrt{
#     \frac{2 V_{sample} \omega
#     }{PQ \mu}
# }$$
# to get
# $$\frac{B_{1,avg}}{\sqrt{P}} = F\sqrt{\frac{Q \mu}{2 V_{sample} \omega}}$$
# Under these circumstances, it should be pretty reasonable to substitue $F = \sqrt{V_{sample}/V_c} \rightarrow \sqrt{\eta}$.
# 
# I think, *btw*, that it would probably be good to request the Mims chapter referenced in [3.] $\rightarrow$ ILL would probably send a PDF.

# In general, it's better to use longer and more clear/descriptive
# variable names $\rightarrow$ especially when you're using vim, and can
# do Ctrl-P and Ctrl-N

# ## I add this to clarify
# 
# For the purposes of calculating the ninety time, I'm just going to substitute our definition of $F$ to get:
# $$\frac{B_{1,avg}}{\sqrt{P}} = \sqrt{\frac{Q \mu}{2 V_c \omega}}$$
# and then approximate $V_c$ as the volume of the coil based off the center diameter

# We can actually derive this equation here in-place.
# 
# Let's say that we have $E$ [J] units of energy stored in the cavity.
# The cavity must be dissipating $E/Q$ [J/rad] units of energy every radian,
# and $E \omega_0/ Q$ [J/s] units of energy per second.
# This must match the power going into the cavity:
# $$P = \frac{E \omega_0}{Q}$$
# Now, what is $E$?
# There is a [standard formula for this](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/engfie.html)
# $$E = \frac{1}{2} \frac{B_{1,lp}^2}{\mu_0} V_c$$
# Where $B_{1,lp}$ is the amplitude of the linearly polarized field in the  lab frame,
# and $V_c$ is Mims' "effective cavity volume," which we take to be the coil volume.
# Now, we have:
# $$P = \frac{1}{2} \frac{B_{1,lp}^2 \omega_0 V_c}{Q \mu_0}$$
# Next we need to note that $B_1$ in the rotating frame is $B_1 = \frac{1}{2} B_{1,lp}$, so that:
# $$P = 2 \frac{B_1^2 V_c \omega_0}{Q \mu_0}$$
# Rearranging to get a conversion factor
# $$\frac{B_1}{\sqrt{P}} = \sqrt{\frac{Q \mu_0}{2 V_c \omega_0}}$$
